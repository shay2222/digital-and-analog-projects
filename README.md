The main focus is on  digital modulation, specifically in the form of amplitude shift keying (ASK).  When it comes to digital modulation, amplitude shift keying (ASK) and frequency shift keying (FSK) are its most basic forms.  The intelligence signal for this modulation will be in digital form.  Pertaining to  the ASK form, the digital signal will be encoded in the amplitude of a carrier. The states that exist within the ASK are the carrier and no-carrier. The no-carrier state is also known as On-Off-Keying (OOK).  The carrier is able to convey intelligence by simply turning on and off, which depends on the prearranged code. This type of transmission is known as continuous wave (CW).
